# Screen to Cloudinary

üöß Work In Progress üöß

## What is this?

A Lambda function.

It takes a screenshot of a given URL, posts the image to a Cloudinary account, and returns the URL of the hosted image.

Original idea comes from the [gatsby-transformer-screenshot](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-screenshot/) plugin for Gatsby.

## How to use

First deploy the function to Lambda:

1. Run `npm run build-lambda-package`.
2. Upload the .zip into Lambda function (through S3, it's too big becuse it has the `node_modules` folder ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
3. Setup all the API Gateway, etc. in AWS.

Send a POST request to the endpoint with a config object in the body. Config options:

| key | required | type | default | details |
|-----|----------|------|---------|---------|
| url | yes | string | - | url to take screenshot of. If not provided, throws error |
| cloudinaryUrl | yes | string | - | Full Cloudinary url (with api_key, api_secret and cloud_name). If not provided and not a test (read below), throws error  |
| cloudinaryFolder | no | string | 'default' | Folder to save the screenshot to |
| fileName | no | string | 'default-[timestamp].jpg' | Filename |
| width | no | number | 1024 | Screenshot width |
| height | no | number | 768 | Screenshot height |
| fullPage | no | boolean | false | Wether to take a screenshot of the whole page or just the _above the fold_ |

If everything works the response will be an object with the status and the screenshot url.

```bash
{
  url: 'http://res.cloudinary.com/.../example.png',
  success: true
}
```

## How to test it

3 tests can be done:

- Run locally and save to `./screenshots`. Tests the pupeteer process is working.
- Run locally and save to Cloudinary. Tests saving to Cloudinary works.
- Run remotelly (in AWS) and save to Cloudinary. Tests that the deploy to AWS and the API Gateway config works.

### Local Test

Takes a screenshot with pupeteer and can save it either to Cloudinary or to filesystem.

- `npm install` first.
  - `puppeteer` needs to be installed as devDep for the function to work locally.

It can save screenshot to local fs, or to Cloudinary. Edit `.env` file to choose:

- Set `SITE_URL` with the url to take screenshot of.
- If `CLOUDINARY_URL` is set, it **saves to Cloudinary**.
- Remove it and set `TEST_WITH_LOCAL_FS` to `true` to **save screenshot to local**. Screenshots will be saved to `./screenshots`.
- Edit `__manual-tests__/config.js` with details about screenshot.
- Execute:

  ```bash
  node __manual-tests__/local-test.js
  ```

### Remote Test

Need to deploy it first. After, tests it making a POST request to the AWS endpoint and it saves to Cloudinary.

Deploy fn to Lambda:

1. Run `npm run build-lambda-package`.
2. Upload the .zip into Lambda function (through S3, it's too big becuse it has the `node_modules` folder ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
3. Setup all the API Gateway, etc. in AWS.

Test the function deployed at `<URL to Lambda endpoint>`:

- Set `LAMBDA_ENDPOINT` and `SITE_URL` env variables **locally**.
- Execute:

  ```bash
  node __manual-tests__/remote-test.js
  ```

## Future

- [ ] Check _cache_: check if a screenshot with the same `fileName` has been taken recently and return that one instead of taking a new one. It can be overwriten with a config setting.
- [x] Manage all test settings from the `__manual-tests__/config.js` file.
- [x] Pass some config for the size of image returned
