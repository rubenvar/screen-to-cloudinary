## [0.1.0]

ðŸŽŠ Initial release

### Added

- Lambda function logic to take a screenshot of a given URL and:
  - Save it to local FS (for testing).
  - Save it to a given Cloudinary account.
- If storing in local, it first checks for the same image in the folder (cached image). If it's found, doesn't take a new one.
